<!-- List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTM1 -->
Use Semantic HTML: Implementing semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, and <footer> provides structure and meaning, making it easier for screen readers and assistive technologies to interpret content.
    Add Alt Text to Images: Descriptive alt text ensures that users with visual impairments can understand the content of images through screen readers.
    Ensure Proper Color Contrast: Use sufficient contrast between text and background colors to make content readable for users with visual impairments, including color blindness.
