Legal Compliance: Many countries have laws mandating accessibility standards for websites to ensure inclusivity for people with disabilities.
Improved User Experience: Accessible websites are generally easier to use for all users, including those on slow networks or older devices.
Benefits:
People with disabilities: Easier navigation and interaction with content.
Elderly users: Simplified interfaces help with age-related impairments.
Mobile users: Optimized designs benefit users on different screen sizes or with poor connectivity.
