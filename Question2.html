<!-- What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities> -->
HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved or non-typable characters in HTML. These entities begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). They are essential because certain characters like <, >, and & have reserved meanings in HTML syntax, so using entities allows these characters to be displayed as text instead of being interpreted as code [3].
